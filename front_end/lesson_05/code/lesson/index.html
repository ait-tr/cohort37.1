    <p>
      Nature is a magnificent wonder, filled with <span>beauty</span> and harmony. Its
      diversity spans from mighty mountains and vast forests to picturesque
      plains and tranquil water bodies. In the mountains, majestic peaks rise
      like guardians, adorned with pristine blankets of snow or lush greenery.
      From there, breathtaking views unfold, and the air is filled with the
      freshness and scent of the wilderness.
